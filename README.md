# Discord Schedule Manager

We followed the guide at https://discordjs.guide/preparations/.

This Discord Bot provides a number of commands which allow users to create and manage schedules, update statuses, and view other members' calendars. You can add and remove events from your calendar, view your schedule laid out in text or in an image format, and update your status based on what you are doing. This allows for more freedom than the basic Discord status. Additionally, the bot will automatically update your status to match any events you currently have going on.

All of the commands can be seen using the >>help command. Make sure you begin using the bot with the >>signup command.

If you copy this repository, make sure you add a Discord Bot Token to the config.json file.
